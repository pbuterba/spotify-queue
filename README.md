# Spotify Queue Manager
This script will inform the user of the ideal point to insert a new song into a Spotify queue, in order for it to start at a specified duration into the queue.
It will also add the song to the queue for you. The only manual part of this process is that the track must be physically dragged to the point in the queue called out.
