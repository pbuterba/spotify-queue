# Spotify Queue Manager
This script allows insertion of "Home" by Chris Tomlin at the beginning of a queue, and "Almost Home"
by Matt Boswell at a specified duration through the queue.

Due to the inability of Spotify to insert a song at a particular point in an existing queue, part of this process must be done manually.
The program will insert "Almost Home" into the queue at the beginning, and will tell you the song that it should appear after to play at
the specified time during the queue. It must be manually dragged to this point in the queue
